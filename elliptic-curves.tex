\paragraph{Pre-waffle}

This is a number theory course, so we care about solving Diophantine equations.
For example, what are the rational solutions of $x^2+y^2=1$?
\begin{equation*}
    x = \frac{2t}{t^2+1}, \quad y = \frac{t^2-1}{t^2+1}, \quad t\in\Q.
\end{equation*}
The general case is impossibly hard; it is formally undecidable. We will focus
on curves, such as one equation with two variables. Life is strongly affected by
the geometry over $\C$, where the curve is a closed orientable surface in
projective space.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Genus 0: The Riemann sphere; $\P^1$. The number theory is easy; either
        there are no $\Q$-solutions or infinitely many nicely parametrized, and
        we can decide which (Hasse principle).

    \item Genus 1 (this course): The torus. There can be no $\Q$-solutions, or
        finitely many, or infinitely many. No proven algorithm exists for the
        general case, although there are algorithms conditional on the
        Tate--Shafarevich conjecture or the BSD conjecture.

    \item Genus $\ge2$: There are finitely many $\Q$-solutions by a theorem of
        Faltings.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
    By Siegel's theorem there are only finitely many $\Z$-solutions for $g\ge1$.
\end{remark}
